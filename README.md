# CSVtoPDF-public
Simple Go program to generate formatted PDFs from CSV data. It takes each row from a CSV file and puts cells from each column into specifically formatted comments in the HTML templates. I can't include any template examples in this since the ones I created are for medical documents (and I would prefer to avoid the risk). See the code to better understand exactly how to format your document. The css file I used in templates is also included. Use the print styles to specify how the page should look when printed to PDF using headless chrome. I would then recommend using some shell scripts around this program to better control the naming and combination of pages using pdfcpu (another Go library/standalone program). 

To use this, you need a chrome installation either in the chrome folder here or change the code to point to your installation. It may also need to be a dev build (as of the creation of this program) in order to support not rendering headers and footers in headless mode.
